# Oasis

This blog is an oasis away from the crowd, for some private talks with you or with my heart.

```{admonition} Brief Self Introduction
This is a blog of Mingran Kong, who is currently an undergraduate student in Fudan University. I have been working in the field of computational physics for more than two years. I mainly concentrate on the ab-initio calculation based on density functional theory (**DFT**), many-body perturbation theory (**MBPT**), topological physics (**Non-abelian braiding**), quantum conputation (**VQE**) and high-throughput computation combining with deep-learning. I'm quite interested in high-performance scientific code development using MPI, OpenMP and GPU accelerator. I'm good at python, Julia, C/C++, CUDA/OpenCL and I also wrote a few Fortran codes.
