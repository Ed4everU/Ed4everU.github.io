    This is a blog of **Mingran Kong**, who is currently an undergraduate student in **Fudan University** in Shanghai. I have been working in the field of computational physics for more than two years. 

    I mainly concentrate on the ab-initio calculation based on density functional theory (**DFT**), many-body perturbation theory (**MBPT**), topological physics (**Non-abelian braiding**), quantum conputation (**VQE**) and high-throughput computation combining with deep-learning. 

    I'm deeply obsessed in **advanced quantum mechanics**, **group theory**, **Green's function in condensed matter theory** and **quantum field theory in condensed matter physics**. 

    I'm quite interested in high-performance scientific code development using **MPI**, **OpenMP** and **GPU** accelerator. I'm good at **Python**, **Julia**, **C/C++**, **CUDA/OpenCL** and I also wrote a few lines of **Fortran** code.

    I have an intrinsic nature of being eager to get an all-round knowledge about this vast and mysterious universe and I even want to be part of some real adventures, which can really lead us to a brighter future.
