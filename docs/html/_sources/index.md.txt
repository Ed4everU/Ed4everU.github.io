## Introduction

```{admonition} Brief Self Introduction
This is a blog of **Mingran Kong**, who is currently an undergraduate student in **Fudan University** in Shanghai. I have been working in the field of computational physics for more than two years. I mainly concentrate on the ab-initio calculation based on density functional theory (**DFT**), many-body perturbation theory (**MBPT**), topological physics (**Non-abelian braiding**), quantum conputation (**VQE**) and high-throughput computation combining with deep-learning. I'm deeply obsessed in **advanced quantum mechanics**, **group theory**, **Green's function in condensed matter theory** and **quantum field theory in condensed matter physics**. I'm quite interested in high-performance scientific code development using **MPI**, **OpenMP** and **GPU** accelerator. I'm good at **Python**, **Julia**, **C/C++**, **CUDA/OpenCL** and I also wrote a few lines of **Fortran** code.
